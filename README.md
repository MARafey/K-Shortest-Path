# K-Shortest-Path
 Our project tackled the K-Shortest Path problem, crucial for applications in routing, navigation, and network optimization. We implemented efficient algorithms using parallel computing with OpenMP for shared-memory and OpenMPI for distributed computing, enhancing performance and scalability to find multiple shortest paths quickly.
